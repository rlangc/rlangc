<h2>Learning Strategy Section</h2>

### What I emphasize!

These Learning Strategies (below) emphasize the importance of continuous, practical, and goal-oriented learning experiences. As adults, we bring prior knowledge and life experience to the process, making it essential to connect new concepts to real-world applications for ongoing growth and adaptability. Technology plays a key role in supporting continuous learning by providing flexible, accessible, and interactive tools such as e-learning platforms, gamified apps, and virtual collaboration tools, enabling learners to engage with new information in ways that suit their evolving needs and schedules.

- [Gamification](https://github.com/rlangc/Gamification.git)
- [Learning Circles and Communities](https://github.com/rlangc/Learning-Circles-and-Communities.git)
- Storytelling (Coming soon!)

>Quick Note: I am always adding and adjusting my strategies as in the fast-paced ever-evolving world we live and work in, it is important to adpat to these changes!
