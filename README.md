<b>Instructional Design: Interactive Checklist with JavaScript:</b>
Our Assignment Progress Tracker is a user-friendly JavaScript tool designed to monitor participants' progress through a series of assignments. With an intuitive interface, users can check off completed tasks, view their overall progress, and stay organized throughout the course. Key features include:

- Computer and Mobile friendly
- Interactive Checkboxes to mark tasks as complete with a simple click or tap
- Real-Time Progress Updates: Automatically calculates and displays completion percentages
- Customizable Assignments: Easily update or add tasks to fit different courses or programs
- Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices, from desktops to smartphones
- Data Persistence: Save progress locally (or optionally integrate with a database for long-term tracking)

This tool helps participants stay on track and provides educators with a clear overview of class engagement and assignment completion.

<h2>Learning Strategy Section</h2>

<b>What I emphasize!</b>

- These Leanring Strategies (below) emphasize the need for practical, goal-oriented, and self-directed learning experiences. As adults we often bring prior knowledge and life experience to the process, making it crucial to connect new concepts to real-world applications. Technology enhances learning by providing flexible, accessible, and interactive tools such as e-learning platforms, gamified apps, and virtual collaboration tools, which cater to diverse learning styles and busy schedules.
