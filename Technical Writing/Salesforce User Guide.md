<h2>2. Getting Started with Salesforce</h2>

<h3>2.1 Accessing Salesforce</h3>

Logging In:

    Open a web browser and go to https://login.salesforce.com.
    Enter your username and password.
    Click Log In.
    If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled, enter the verification code sent to your registered device.

Navigating the Interface

Salesforce offers two primary UI versions:

    Lightning Experience (modern UI)
    Salesforce Classic (legacy UI)

By default, Salesforce uses Lightning Experience, which provides a modern and intuitive interface.
Key Navigation Elements in Lightning Experience
Component	Description
App Launcher	Provides access to different Salesforce apps (Sales, Service, Custom Apps).
Navigation Bar	Displays frequently used objects like Accounts, Leads, Contacts, and Cases.
Global Search	Allows users to search for any record across Salesforce.
Home Page	Shows personalized dashboards, reports, and tasks.
Setup (Admin Panel)	Used by administrators to configure settings, users, and workflows.
Utility Bar	Provides quick access to tools like Notes, Chat, and Calendar.

2.2 Personalizing Your Experience

Users can customize their home page, navigation, and display preferences:

Updating User Preferences:
- Click your profile picture (top-right corner).
- Select Settings.
- Navigate to Display & Layout to adjust the theme, UI density, and list views.
- Save your changes.

Customizing the Navigation Bar

    Click the pencil (✏️) icon on the navigation bar.
    Drag and drop objects (Leads, Opportunities, Accounts) to reorder them.
    Click Save to apply the changes.

2.3 Understanding Record Management in Salesforce

Salesforce stores data as records within objects.

    Objects are tables that store data (e.g., Accounts, Contacts, Leads).
    Records are individual entries within an object (e.g., a single customer account).
    Fields hold data in records (e.g., Name, Email, Phone Number).

Creating a New Record

    Navigate to the object (e.g., Leads).
    Click New.
    Fill in the required fields.
    Click Save.

Editing a Record

    Open the record.
    Click Edit.
    Modify the necessary fields.
    Click Save.

Deleting a Record

    Open the record.
    Click the dropdown (▼) next to the Edit button.
    Select Delete → Confirm deletion.

2.4 Searching & Filtering Data
Global Search

Salesforce’s Global Search (top bar) helps users find records quickly.

    Start typing a keyword (e.g., "Acme Inc.")
    Salesforce suggests results in real time.
    Click on a record to open it.

Using List Views to Filter Data

    Navigate to an object (e.g., Leads).
    Click the List View dropdown (top-left).
    Select an existing list or create a new filter.
    Click Save to apply the view.
