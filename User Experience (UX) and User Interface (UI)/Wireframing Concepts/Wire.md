# From Concept to Interface: My Wireframing Process

In the Wireframing section of my portfolio, I showcase my approach to structuring and designing user interfaces for SaaS platforms, instructional design tools, and mobile applications. I focus on low-fidelity wireframes to map out structure and user flow before refining them into more detailed designs.

This section includes categorized wireframe samples, each annotated to highlight key elements such as navigation, UI components, and user interaction. I also provide insight into my design process, starting from initial sketches and ideation to creating structured wireframes using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Balsamiq.

To enhance the presentation, I include either static wireframes with clear descriptions or interactive prototypes that demonstrate user flow. Additionally, I reflect on my design decisions, lessons learned, and future improvements, ensuring a thoughtful and iterative approach to UI/UX design.
