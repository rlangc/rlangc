# From Concept to Interface: My Wireframing Process

In the Wireframing section of my portfolio, I showcase my approach to structuring and designing user interfaces for SaaS platforms, instructional design tools, and mobile applications. I focus on low-fidelity wireframes to map out structure and user flow before refining them into more detailed designs.

This section includes categorized wireframe samples, each annotated to highlight key elements such as navigation, UI components, and user interaction. I also provide insight into my design process, starting from initial sketches and ideation to creating structured wireframes using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Balsamiq.

To enhance the presentation, I include either static wireframes with clear descriptions or interactive prototypes that demonstrate user flow. Additionally, I reflect on my design decisions, lessons learned, and future improvements, ensuring a thoughtful and iterative approach to UI/UX design.

<h1>SaaS Platform Dashboard</h1>

- A structured dashboard with a top navigation bar for settings and controls
- A main analytics section displaying key metrics and graphs
- A recent activity panel showing updates, logs, or notifications
- The layout is grid-based, making it scalable and modular

```
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea";
import { BarChart, LayoutDashboard, List, Settings } from "lucide-react";

// SaaS Platform Dashboard Component
export function SaaSPlatformDashboard() {
  return (
    <Card className="p-4 border-dashed border-2">
      <CardContent>
        <div className="flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">SaaS Platform Dashboard</h2>
          <Button variant="outline">Settings</Button>
        </div>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
          <div className="col-span-2 border-dashed border-2 h-32 flex items-center justify-center text-gray-500">

        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
