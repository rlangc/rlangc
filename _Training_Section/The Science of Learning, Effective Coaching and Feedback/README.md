# The Science of Learning, Effective Coaching & Feedback

This content was developed while attending the *Science of Learning, Effective Coaching & Feedback* course at the **United States Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center in July 2025**.  

In this file, you will find key notes, learning activities, and reference content related to the course, with a focus on its application to instructional design, professional development, and eLearning environments.

## Course Overview and Description

This course from the Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training emphasizes evidence-based learning strategies designed to foster **durable**, **flexible**, and **transferable** knowledge. It equips facilitators with the cognitive science behind how adults learn and how to support learning through purposeful practice, effective feedback, and learner-centered instruction.

## Core Learning Concepts

- **Learning is a process** of encoding, storing, and retrieving information. True learning isn’t complete until learners can retrieve and apply what they’ve learned.
- **Short-term vs. Long-term Memory:** Instruction should be designed to support the transition of information from short-term to long-term memory through rehearsal, sleep, and practice.
- **Adult Learning Theory (Knowles):** Adults need relevance, autonomy, respect, and experience-based learning environments.
- **Effortful Learning:** Learning should be challenging but not overwhelming. “Desirable difficulties” improve retention and transfer.
- **Active Learning:** Engages learners in doing and thinking. Making thinking visible helps instructors gauge understanding.
- **Retrieval Practice:** Reactivating stored knowledge makes it easier to recall in the future and promotes lasting learning.
- **Cognitive Load Theory:** Instruction must balance three types of cognitive load:
  - **Intrinsic** – Inherent task complexity
  - **Extraneous** – Avoidable distractions
  - **Germane** – Mental effort that supports learning

## Instructional Strategies

- **Interleaving (Contextual Interference):** Mixing up the practice of different skills improves learning transfer and application under varied conditions.
- **Spaced Practice:** Breaking up content over time leads to better long-term retention than block-style instruction.
- **Varied Contexts:** Training in multiple settings and formats enhances adaptability, memory cues, and generalization.
- **Instructional Mindset Shift:** Instructors must shift from delivering content to facilitating the extraction and application of knowledge through challenge and retrieval.

## Coaching & Feedback Principles

- **Effective Feedback Drives Growth:** Research shows that only one-third of feedback improves performance. The rest can be neutral or even detrimental.
- **Feedback is effective when it is:**
  - **Specific** – Identifies exactly what needs improvement
  - **Prioritized** – Focuses on the most critical feedback areas
  - **Timely** – Delivered during the appropriate stage of learning
  - **Balanced** – Highlights both strengths and areas for improvement

### Feedback Model

1. **What does good performance look like?**
2. **Where is the learner now?**
3. **How can they close the gap?**
