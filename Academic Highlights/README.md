My academic background combines a deep understanding of instructional design theory with a strong foundation in design thinking, systems thinking, and user experience, cultivated through my Master of Science in Instructional Design and Technology (IDT) and Bachelor of Science in Design Studies.

Master of Science – Instructional Design & Technology (IDT)

My graduate studies in Instructional Design and Technology focused on the design, development, and evaluation of effective learning systems using research-based methodologies. This program strengthened my ability to create scalable, user-centered learning solutions for diverse audiences, with a particular emphasis on adult learning, digital transformation, and technology-enabled instruction.

<h3>Highlights include:</h3>

- Leading the design and execution of a 40+ page program evaluation of the Coalfield Development 33-6-3 workforce training model, using both qualitative and quantitative methods to inform continuous improvement and workforce development strategy.
- Creating scenario-based, gamified, and simulation-driven learning projects that applied models such as SAM, Kirkpatrick, and Design Thinking.
- Developing high-quality learning objectives, assessment strategies, and digital content that aligned with accessibility, equity, and organizational learning goals.
- Producing detailed instructional assets, user guides, and performance support materials, reinforcing my ability to translate instructional theory into enterprise-ready solutions.

<h3>Bachelor of Science – Design Studies</h3>

My undergraduate degree in Design Studies laid the groundwork for my user-centered, systems-based approach to problem solving. Rooted in design theory and interdisciplinary thinking, this program emphasized creative strategy, spatial and visual communication, and iterative design processes.

Through this lens, I learned to:

- Apply human-centered design principles to complex challenges—skills that now directly inform my instructional design, UX/UI development, and content architecture decisions.
- Build foundational knowledge of design research, critique, prototyping, and storytelling, all of which have carried into my work with digital learning environments, enterprise platforms, and instructional content creation.
